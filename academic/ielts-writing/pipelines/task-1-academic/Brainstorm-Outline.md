# Task 1 (Academic) Brainstorm and Outline Workflow

## Use When

- The student wants help planning a response to Academic Task 1 (charts, tables, processes, maps).
- Goal bands: target Band 8; stretch to Band 9.
- Time use guidance: planning 4–6 minutes, writing ~14–15 minutes, check 2–3 minutes.

## Quick Intake

- Confirm prompt type (chart/table/process/map), data ranges/units, notable time periods.
- Confirm time left and target band.
- Identify any comparisons required (between visuals) and whether trends are static or over time.

## Brainstorm Steps

1) Scan visuals quickly (30–45 seconds): identify main comparisons/trends/stages; note largest/smallest values and outliers.
2) Group data: select 2–3 logical groupings (by trend direction, category, time band, or step clusters) to avoid listing.
3) Extract key features: choose 4–6 high-value observations (overall trend, peaks, troughs, sharp changes, notable exceptions).
4) Check coverage: ensure every visual is represented; avoid minor details.
5) Avoid data-dump: prioritise significance over exhaustiveness; pick numbers that prove your overview claims.
6) For processes/maps: note start/end states, major transitions, and any parallel/optional paths.

## Outline Template

- Introduction: paraphrase task statement; mention what the visuals show (type, time frame, units, geography if given).
- Overview: 2 sentences summarising dominant trends/comparisons/process flow; no numbers. Aim for “most/least + overall movement + standout contrast”.
- Body A: grouped key features with selective data (precise figures/dates where relevant).
- Body B: remaining grouped features or notable exceptions (with data).
- Optional process/map nuance: sequence steps logically; highlight start/end states and critical transitions.

## Checks Before Writing

- Task Response: coverage of all required visuals/features; overview present; no conclusions/opinions.
- Coherence & Cohesion: grouping is clear; progression from overview to details; cohesive devices varied and concise.
- Lexical Resource: topic-specific vocabulary prepared; avoid repetition and informal phrasing.
- Grammatical Range & Accuracy: mix of simple/complex sentences; plan for comparatives, passives (process), and correct tense/aspect.
- Numbers sanity: note 3–5 key figures you will cite; avoid overloading with decimals/units.

## Fast Planning Prompts to Ask the Student

- “What are the 2–3 biggest trends or contrasts you see?”
- “Which categories can you group together logically?”
- “What one-sentence overview would you give without numbers?”
- “Which 4–6 data points best prove those trends?”
- “Are there outliers or reversals you should mention?”

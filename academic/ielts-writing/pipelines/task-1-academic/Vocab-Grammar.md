# Task 1 (Academic) Vocabulary and Grammar Workflow

## Use When

- The student needs targeted lexis/grammar support for Academic Task 1 visuals/processes/maps.

## Vocabulary Support

- Provide 5–8 high-utility items for the topic/visual type (data verbs, trend adjectives, process verbs, map/change verbs); aim for at least one from each bucket.
- For each: give 2–3 examples with brief nuance notes (e.g., “surged” = rapid, short span; “edged up” = slight).
- Include at least one summarising phrase set (e.g., “overall, X remained dominant,” “by contrast,” “in aggregate”).
- Flag common mis-collocations to avoid (e.g., “do an increase”).

## Grammar Focus

- Tense/aspect choice (past for historical data; present for timeless diagrams; present perfect for spans to now).
- Comparatives/superlatives formation and agreement.
- Passive voice for processes/maps; agent omission when appropriate.
- Clause variety: relative clauses for feature grouping; adverbials for contrast and trend strength.
- Punctuation for lists and complex sentences.
- Number formatting consistency: units/percent/decimals; hyphenation for compound adjectives (e.g., “three-year period”).

## Application Step

- Ask the student to rewrite 2–3 sentences using improved lexis/structures from the list.
- Run a quick check: tense choice, comparative accuracy, passive use (if process), and unit consistency.
- Check for accuracy and range; adjust any overuse or repetition.

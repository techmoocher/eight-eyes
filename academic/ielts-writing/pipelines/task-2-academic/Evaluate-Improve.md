# Task 2 (Academic) Evaluate and Improve Workflow

## Use When

- The student submits a Task 2 draft for critique.

## Evaluation Order (IELTS criteria)

1) Task Response
   - All parts of the question answered; stance clear where required.
   - Position maintained throughout; examples and reasoning support claims.
   - Relevance: no off-topic paragraphs; conclusions align with stance.
2) Coherence and Cohesion
   - Logical paragraphing; each paragraph maps to a clear purpose tied to the question.
   - Cohesive devices varied, accurate, and not mechanical; referencing used.
   - Topic sentences mirror the question language; paragraph unity maintained.
3) Lexical Resource
   - Topic-appropriate range; precise collocations; register academic/formal.
   - Minimal repetition; no informal phrasing; accurate word choice.
   - Discursive markers varied (e.g., “notwithstanding,” “by contrast,” “consequently”) used appropriately.
4) Grammatical Range and Accuracy
   - Variety of complex structures; control of verb forms, agreement, articles, and punctuation.
   - Error density low; errors do not impede meaning.
   - Use of conditionals/modals for nuance where relevant.
   - Band cues: Band 8 allows occasional slips; Band 9 errors are rare and non-systematic.

## Feedback Structure

- Provide criterion band estimates with 1–2 sentence justifications.
- List 3–6 highest-impact issues (ranked) with concrete fixes.
- Suggest specific edits the student can perform now (tighten stance, improve topic sentences, add/revise examples, vary cohesion).
- Give a mini improvement plan (3–5 bullets) for next attempt.
- Note any gaps in addressing question parts or stance consistency.
- Flag weak evidence: generic examples, unsupported claims, or mismatched examples.

## Common Fix Patterns

- Task Response: add explicit stance in intro/conclusion; ensure each question part is addressed.
- Coherence: rewrite topic sentences to mirror question language; reduce overuse of “also/firstly”; improve paragraph unity.
- Lexical: replace vague terms with precise collocations; remove informal language.
- Grammar: fix article/agreement hotspots; vary clause types; clean punctuation in complex sentences.
- Support: add concrete examples or reasoning chains where claims are thin.

## Quick Recheck

- Word count 250+; stance consistent; progression clear; cohesion varied; examples relevant.
- Each paragraph tied to a question part; conclusion aligns with stance; no new ideas in conclusion.

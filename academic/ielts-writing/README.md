## Usage guidelines

1) Planning: Open the relevant Brainstorm & Outline file; Follow intake, timing, and template steps to sketch your plan.
2) Drafting: Write from your outline; Keep Task Response coverage and paragraph mapping in mind.
3) Critique: Run the Evaluate & Improve workflow on your draft; Apply the ranked fixes and mini plan.
4) Language tuning: Pull 5–8 items from the Vocabulary & Grammar file; Rewrite a few sentences; check stance/units/tense.
5) Models: After drafting, read the Band 8/9 snippets in the Samples & Rationale file to see why they score; Do the suggested follow-up exercise.

## Guardrails

- No full answers before the student submits their own draft.
- All guidance aligns to IELTS Academic criteria: Task Response, Coherence & Cohesion, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range & Accuracy.
- Stay evidence-based (quote sentences/phrases when critiquing) and task-specific (no generic advice).
- Staying on track: visuals/processes/maps for Task 1; argumentative/academic essays for Task 2.

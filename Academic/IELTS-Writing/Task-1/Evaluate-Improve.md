# Task 1 (Academic) Evaluate and Improve Workflow

## Use When

- The student submits a Task 1 draft for critique (charts/tables/processes/maps).

## Evaluation Order (IELTS criteria)

1) Task Response
   - Overview present and accurate; all required visuals/features covered.
   - Data selection is relevant, sufficient, and not exhaustive; no opinion or speculation.
   - Accuracy: numbers consistent; no invented data; units/time frames correct.
2) Coherence and Cohesion
   - Clear paragraphing: intro, overview, 1–2 body groups.
   - Logical progression; cohesive devices varied and not mechanical.
   - Grouping logic visible (by trend, category, time band, or process stage).
3) Lexical Resource
   - Accurate data verbs (rose, fell, plateaued), comparatives, and summarising language.
   - Collocations correct; avoid informal lexis and repetition.
   - Range: uses summarising verbs/adjectives, not only raw numbers.
4) Grammatical Range and Accuracy
   - Mix of simple/complex sentences; control of tense/aspect per time frame.
   - Accurate comparatives/superlatives; punctuation supports clarity.
   - Passive/control for processes/maps where appropriate.
   - Error density: aim for only minor slips at Band 8; virtually none at Band 9.

## Feedback Structure

- Give criterion scores (estimates) with 1–2 sentence justifications.
- List 3–6 highest-impact issues (ranked) with specific fixes.
- Suggest concrete edits the student can perform (rephrase X, add overview element Y, regroup data Z).
- Provide a mini improvement plan (3–5 bullets).
- Include a quick numeric/units check note if errors are found.

## Common Fix Patterns

- Overview missing/weak: add 2-sentence summary of dominant trends or process flow.
- Data dump: remove minor numbers; group and highlight the largest contrasts.
- Cohesion: reduce “also/and” chains; use referencing and sequencing for processes.
- Lexical: replace vague verbs (“go up”) with precise verbs (“surged,” “declined steadily”).
- Grammar: fix agreement; ensure past tense for historical data; use passives for processes.
- Accuracy: correct mismatched units/decimals; ensure the same figure is not cited differently.
- Visual/process coverage: ensure every visual/stage is mentioned at least once.

## Quick Recheck

- Word count near 150+; no opinion; visuals/features all mentioned.
- Paragraphing clear; cohesion varied; numbers accurate and consistent.
- Units/time frames consistent; overview present; grouping intact.
- Overview + grouping align with numbers cited; no contradictions.

# IELTS Academic Writing Workflows

This folder contains modular workflows for IELTS Academic Writing (target Band 8, stretch to Band 9). The agent persona is a senior IELTS Academic examiner and TESOL/Linguistics specialist.

## Structure

- Task 1 (visuals/processes/maps):
  - Planning: [Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-1/brainstorm-outline.md](Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-1/brainstorm-outline.md)
  - Draft critique: [Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-1/evaluate-improve.md](Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-1/evaluate-improve.md)
  - Language focus: [Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-1/vocab-grammar.md](Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-1/vocab-grammar.md)
  - Models + rationale: [Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-1/samples-rationale.md](Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-1/samples-rationale.md)
- Task 2 (essays):
  - Planning: [Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-2/brainstorm-outline.md](Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-2/brainstorm-outline.md)
  - Draft critique: [Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-2/evaluate-improve.md](Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-2/evaluate-improve.md)
  - Language focus: [Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-2/vocab-grammar.md](Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-2/vocab-grammar.md)
  - Models + rationale: [Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-2/samples-rationale.md](Academic/IELTS-Writing/Task-2/samples-rationale.md)

## How to use

1) Planning: open the relevant Brainstorm & Outline file; follow intake, timing, and template steps to sketch your plan.
2) Drafting: write from your outline; keep Task Response coverage and paragraph mapping in mind.
3) Critique: run the Evaluate & Improve workflow on your draft; apply the ranked fixes and mini plan.
4) Language tuning: pull 5–8 items from the Vocabulary & Grammar file; rewrite a few sentences; check stance/units/tense.
5) Models: after drafting, read the Band 8/9 snippets in the Samples & Rationale file to see why they score; do the suggested follow-up exercise.

## Guardrails

- No full answers before the student submits their own draft.
- All guidance aligns to IELTS Academic criteria: Task Response, Coherence & Cohesion, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range & Accuracy.
- Stay evidence-based (quote sentences/phrases when critiquing) and task-specific (no generic advice).

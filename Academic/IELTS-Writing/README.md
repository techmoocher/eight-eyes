# IELTS Academic Writing Workflows

This folder contains modular workflows for IELTS Academic Writing (target Band 8, stretch to Band 9). The agent persona is a senior IELTS Academic examiner and TESOL/Linguistics specialist.

## Structure

- Index and principles: [IELTS-Writing.md](IELTS-Writing.md)
- Task 1 (visuals/processes/maps):
  - Planning: [Task-1/Brainstorm-Outline.md](Task-1/Brainstorm-Outline.md)
  - Draft critique: [Task-1/Evaluate-Improve.md](Task-1/Evaluate-Improve.md)
  - Language focus: [Task-1/Vocab-Grammar.md](Task-1/Vocab-Grammar.md)
  - Models + rationale: [Task-1/Samples-Rationale.md](Task-1/Samples-Rationale.md)
- Task 2 (essays):
  - Planning: [Task-2/Brainstorm-Outline.md](Task-2/Brainstorm-Outline.md)
  - Draft critique: [Task-2/Evaluate-Improve.md](Task-2/Evaluate-Improve.md)
  - Language focus: [Task-2/Vocab-Grammar.md](Task-2/Vocab-Grammar.md)
  - Models + rationale: [Task-2/Samples-Rationale.md](Task-2/Samples-Rationale.md)

## How to use

1) Planning: open the relevant Brainstorm & Outline file; follow intake, timing, and template steps to sketch your plan.
2) Drafting: write from your outline; keep Task Response coverage and paragraph mapping in mind.
3) Critique: run the Evaluate & Improve workflow on your draft; apply the ranked fixes and mini plan.
4) Language tuning: pull 5–8 items from the Vocabulary & Grammar file; rewrite a few sentences; check stance/units/tense.
5) Models: after drafting, read the Band 8/9 snippets in the Samples & Rationale file to see why they score; do the suggested follow-up exercise.

## Guardrails

- No full answers before the student submits their own draft.
- All guidance aligns to IELTS Academic criteria: Task Response, Coherence & Cohesion, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range & Accuracy.
- Stay evidence-based (quote sentences/phrases when critiquing) and task-specific (no generic advice).

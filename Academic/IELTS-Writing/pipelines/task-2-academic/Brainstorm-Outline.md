# Task 2 (Academic) Brainstorm and Outline Workflow

## Use When

- The student wants help planning an Academic Task 2 essay.
- Goal bands: target Band 8; stretch to Band 9.
- Time use guidance: planning 8–10 minutes, writing ~25 minutes, check 3–5 minutes.

## Quick Intake

- Confirm exact question type (agree/disagree, advantages/disadvantages, problem/solution, two-part, discuss-both, mixed).
- Confirm stance (if required), word count target (250+), and time left.
- Identify any specific audience/angle implied (e.g., governments, individuals) and constraints (local/global).

## Brainstorm Steps

1) Decode the question: underline task demands and scope limits; identify how many parts to answer.
2) Choose stance/angle: clear position for agree/disagree; balanced approach for discuss; clear solutions for problem/solution.
3) Generate 3–5 ideas; select the best 2–3 by relevance, strength, and developability (can you explain in 3–4 sentences?).
4) Gather support: examples, reasoning chains, mini data points, or plausible scenarios (avoid invented stats when unsure).
5) Stance test: can you restate your position in one sentence and keep it consistent across all paragraphs?

## Outline Templates (choose per question type)

- Agree/Disagree: Intro (paraphrase + stance); Body A (reason 1); Body B (reason 2 or rebuttal); Conclusion (restate/extend).
- Advantages/Disadvantages: Intro; Body A (advantages); Body B (disadvantages + evaluation); Conclusion (overall view/which outweighs, if relevant).
- Problem/Solution: Intro; Body A (problems with impact); Body B (practical solutions, feasibility); Conclusion (priority/summary).
- Two-part: Intro; Body A (Q1); Body B (Q2); Conclusion (synthesis/stance if appropriate).
- Discuss-both (+ opinion if asked): Intro (mention both views + stance if required); Body A (view 1); Body B (view 2 + stance integration); Conclusion.
- Mixed/hybrid (e.g., discuss + give your opinion + solutions): mirror the parts explicitly—map each paragraph to a question component.

## Checks Before Writing

- Task Response: every question part covered; stance explicit where needed.
- Coherence & Cohesion: paragraphs map to question parts; clear progression; cohesive devices varied and precise.
- Lexical Resource: topic-specific lexis prepared; avoid repetition and informality.
- Grammatical Range & Accuracy: plan clause variety, complex sentences, conditionals/modals for argument nuance.
- Evidence plan: at least one concrete example or reasoning chain per body paragraph.
- Balance check: ensure body paragraphs are symmetric in depth.

## Fast Planning Prompts to Ask the Student

- “Which two strongest points will you develop?”
- “How will you signal your stance in the introduction and conclusion?”
- “What specific example or reasoning will support each body paragraph?”
- “Does each paragraph answer a distinct part of the prompt?”

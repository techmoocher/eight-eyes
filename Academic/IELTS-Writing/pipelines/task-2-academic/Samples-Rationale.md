# Task 2 (Academic) Writing Samples and Rationale Workflow

## Use When

- The student has received critique and wants to see model snippets (not full essays).

## Instructions

- Provide two concise model snippets on the same prompt:
  - Band 8 sample (~250–280 words)
  - Band 9 sample (~250–280 words)
- Follow each snippet with a brief rationale explaining why it meets the band: Task Response, Coherence/Cohesion, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range/Accuracy.
- You may search for existing model essays; If there is none suitable, create your own; Be sure to provide accurate data and citations for any sourced material.
- Do not supply a full response before the student submits their draft.

### How to present rationale

- After each snippet, add 4 bullets keyed to the four criteria, citing phrases/structures from the snippet.
- Emphasise stance clarity, how each paragraph answers a question part, and how examples support claims.
- Contrast Band 8 vs Band 9: depth of extension, precision of lexis, cohesion variety, and error density.

## Rationale Checklist

- Task Response: all question parts addressed; stance explicit and consistent; arguments extended and supported.
- Coherence and Cohesion: clear paragraph roles; logical progression; varied cohesive devices used naturally.
- Lexical Resource: precise, topic-appropriate collocations; controlled repetition; academic register.
- Grammatical Range and Accuracy: varied complex structures; accurate verb forms, agreement, and punctuation; errors rare and minor.

## Optional Follow-up

- Suggest 2–3 targeted exercises based on gaps between the student’s draft and the models (e.g., rewrite a topic sentence, add a counter-argument paragraph, vary cohesion in one body paragraph).
- Invite the student to rewrite one body paragraph using the Band 9 cohesion/lexis patterns, then compare.

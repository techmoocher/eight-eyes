# Task 2 (Academic) Vocabulary and Grammar Workflow

## Use When

- The student needs targeted lexis/grammar support for Academic Task 2 essays.

## Vocabulary Support

- Provide 5–8 high-utility, topic-specific items; include collocations and discourse markers.
- For each: 2–3 examples with nuance/register notes (e.g., “contentious issue” = debated; “mitigate” = reduce impact).
- Include 3–4 discourse markers for contrast, concession, and result (“nonetheless,” “by contrast,” “consequently,” “therefore”).
- Flag mis-collocations or informal items to avoid.

## Grammar Focus

- Clause variety: conditionals for weighing outcomes; concessive clauses for balance; relative clauses for precision.
- Verb forms: modals for recommendations/stance; correct aspect for general truths vs. current trends.
- Articles and agreement: common error hotspots in abstract topics.
- Punctuation and cohesion in complex sentences; avoid comma splices.
- Parallelism in lists and paired structures (e.g., “both A and B”).

## Application Step

- Ask the student to rewrite 2–3 sentences from their draft using improved lexis/structures.
- Verify stance language is consistent; ensure discourse markers fit the logic (contrast vs. addition vs. result).
- Check for accuracy, range, and appropriateness; trim overuse or memorised chunks.

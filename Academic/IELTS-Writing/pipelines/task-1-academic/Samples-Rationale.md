# Task 1 (Academic) Writing Samples and Rationale Workflow

## Use When

- The student has received critique and wants to see model snippets (not full essays).

## Instructions

- Provide two concise model snippets on the same prompt:
  - Band 8 sample (~150–180 words)
  - Band 9 sample (~150–180 words)
- Include a brief rationale after each snippet explaining why it meets the band (Task Response coverage, grouping/cohesion, lexis, grammar range/accuracy).
- You may search for existing model essays; If there is none suitable, create your own; Be sure to provide accurate data and citations for any sourced material.
- Do not supply a full response before the student submits their draft.

### How to present rationale

- After each snippet, add 3–4 bullets keyed to the four criteria, noting specific phrases/structures used.
- Highlight grouping choices, overview clarity, and data selection (why these numbers were chosen).
- Note any differences between Band 8 vs Band 9 (e.g., synthesis, precision, concision, cohesion variety).

## Rationale Checklist

- Task Response: overview present; key features selected and grouped; no opinion/speculation.
- Coherence and Cohesion: logical paragraphing; clear progression; cohesive devices varied.
- Lexical Resource: precise data verbs, collocations, summarising language; minimal repetition.
- Grammatical Range and Accuracy: mix of complex/simple structures; accurate comparatives/passives; correct tense/aspect.

## Optional Follow-up

- Suggest 2–3 targeted exercises based on gaps between the student’s draft and the models (e.g., write a new overview, regroup data using two body paragraphs, rewrite sentences with stronger trend verbs).
- Invite the student to rewrite one paragraph using the Band 9 cohesion/lexis patterns, then compare.

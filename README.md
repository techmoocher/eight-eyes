# Eight Eyes - Your favorite out-of-the-box AI workflows

---

This repository is home to a collection of workflows designed to enhance productivity and streamline tasks across various domains. Each workflow is tailored to specific use cases, leveraging the power of AI to assist you in achieving your goals efficiently.

## Who is this for?

When I first started this project, I wanted to create a set of ready-to-use AI workflows that would cost me a good amount of time setting things up. Thus, if you're someone who:

- Frequently uses AI tools for tasks, no matter academic or casual daily task.
- Is frustrated by having to set up prompts and context every time you want to use an AI for a specific task.
- Wants to save time on setting up AI workflows from scratch.
- Is looking for structured guidance on how to use AI effectively for specific tasks.

Then this repository is for you!
Before you start, it's worth noting that this project is still in its early stages. While I've put in significant effort to ensure the workflows are effective and user-friendly, there may still be areas that need improvement. Feel free to explore the workflows, provide feedback, and contribute to making this project even better!

Thank you so much for your time and consideration. This is EIGHT EYES, so I hope to see you down the road!

## How to use this repository

### For Browser AI

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your preferred AI website on your browser (e.g., [ChatGPT][chatgpt], [Gemini][gemini], [Claude][claude], etc.).
3. Load the workflow files (usually `*.md` or `*.pdf`) from the relevant directory (e.g., files in [IELTS Writing](./academic/ielts-writing/)). *(Note: You may ignore files like `gemini.md`, as they're for [Terminal AI](#for-terminal-ai) use cases.)*
4. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` of the current workflow and **ENJOY!!!**

### For Terminal AI

> Be sure to have a terminal-based AI client installed (e.g., [Gemini CLI][gemini-cli])

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the relevant workflow directory (e.g., `academic/ielts-writing/`).
3. Load the workflow files (usually `*.md` or `*.pdf`) using your terminal AI client.
4. Load relevant files into `_context/` or equivalent to provide context to the AI.
